Jenkins instruction:

prerequisites: Jenkins should be installed

1. Open commandline where jenkins is located
    a) Start jenkins in your local server using this command -> java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=9090
    b) open in browser -> localhost:9090 and wait for jenkins getting to work
    c) login to jenkins
2. We have to create new job for our needs on Jenkins
    a) Select "New Item" on left panel
    b) Name the new Job -> Select Freestyle project
    c) First we have to select from where the code will be taken
        I) Select "Advanced.." option to select "Use custom workspace"
        II) Select the path from your IDE of your project into input
    d) Build -> Select dropdown and select "Invoke top-level Maven targets" -> Because in this project we're using maven
        I) We have to enter command like "test -<profileName if we want it without brackets> -Dbrowser=<browser>"
    e) Save the Jon
    d) Build now and test it


    Configure the JOB

1. In dashboard open "Configure"
2. Find checkbox called "This project is parameterized"
    a) In name type "browserName"
    b) In "choices" type all browsers, which you want to use for that job
    c) Go to "Build" and change the command
        I) test -<profileName if we want it without brackets> -Dbrowser="$browserName" -> "$browserName" is a variable now for browsers

    d) save the configuration
    e) Build with Parameters and select which browser you want to invoke

3. Set the variable for profiles as well
    a) open "Configure"
    b) Add another parameter dropdown and select "choice parameter"
    c) Called as "Profile"
    d) and add your profiles names in to choices
    e) Change the command test -P"$Profile" -Dbrowser="$browserName"
